<h2>About me</h2><br>
<p>Hi there! <b>I am Raquel Vives</b>. I have a Bachelor's degree in English Studies and I have more than three years of experience teaching english at various levels, in addition to participating in various seminars and linguistic research studies.</p>
<p>ðŸ’¼ My experience has provided me with a solid and deep knowledge of the structure and use of language. My true passion lies in the fields of linguistics and technology, that is why I want to apply this knowledge in a more technical environment such as Computational Linguistics. As a language and research enthusiast, I am always eager to acquire new knowledge and skills to improve my abilities as a professional.
</p>
<p>ðŸ•¶ I have studied Language Technologies for Conversational Interfaces at the CÃ¡lamo & Cran Academy, where I gained technical skills in Dialogflow management, dialogue flow creation, conversational interface training, and chatbot creation and integration. In addition, I am currently self-studying NLP courses and programming with HTML and Python.
